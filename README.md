# cnn-microstructures
Code from my Bachelor Thesis.
It is focused on creating CNNs and evaluating predictions of microstructure properties for different parameters.

# Notebooks
The notebooks were used to do a variety of things.
'''randomMatrixGen''' can be used to generate more data. It is based on code by Tim Duka.


# Data
In the repository for each image size a data set with contrast ratio 100 (or 0.01) and its binary and two-point variants is provided.
On request I can provide the remaining contrast ratio data sets and other variants :)
